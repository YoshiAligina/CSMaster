# Float is like a number that is fractional.  ex : 2.0
# Boolean only has two values "True" and "False"
# num = 3 < 4 , num is printed as true!

# In python you can use either single or double quotes for a phrase as long as they match.

# The other way we can do the above is with an escape string, like \ which makes it a character.
# Upper camel case is usually used for classes

# Used to return the type of the item returned

# adding a . after the int turns the result of n + m into a float.

print( 5/2)

#Int division, reverse mod.
print(14//3)

# MOD like java! 14/3 is 4 R 2 answer will be 2.
print(14%3)

# Exponentiation
print(2**3)

# The absolute value is the the positive value.
print(abs (-3.204))

print(min(23,41,15,24))
print(max(23,41,15,24))
#min() (resp., max()) takes an arbitrary number of inputs and return the “smallest” (“largest”) among them

# DO Not use the == sign to find the equality of floats.

# Boolean expressions may be combined using Boolean operators and, or, and not

print('_' * 5)
#been on EVERY exam

print(len(num4))
#length of phrase

#Arrays start with zero!!!!
