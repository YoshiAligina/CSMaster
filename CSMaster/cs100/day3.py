- A list is a list that is a comma separated sequence within square brackets.

- Lists can be modified; they are said to be mutable
- Strings canâ€™t be modified; they are said to be immutable
- You can not sum five strings. It is an unsupported operand type.
- len() and sum() are examples of functions that can be called with a list input
argument; they can also be called on other types of input
- There are also functions that are called on a list;
such functions are called list methods
- For a max in a string series, you will typically get the furthest in the dictionary.
